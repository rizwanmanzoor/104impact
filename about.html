        <h2>Joy Abiola</h2>
        <h3>Founder</h3>
        <p>
          Joy’s career began in private equity before moving through secondaries advisory and fund placement into the
          world of venture capital, building a breadth of expertise across capital markets, fundraising and cross-border
          dealmaking. Along the way, she has cultivated a trusted global network of allocators spanning sovereign funds,
          institutions, and some of the world’s most discreet and influential family offices across Africa, Europe, the
          GCC and the US. She has supported over $1 billion in capital deployment across a diverse set of mandates.
        </p>
        <p>
          The turning point came with the birth of her daughter in a time of profound global uncertainty. It sharpened
          Joy’s focus on what matters — building a future where people and planet are centred, and the most catalytic
          entrepreneurs are not just funded but truly supported.
        </p>
        <p>
          She launched 104 Impact as the right-hand partner to founders solving real, unmet needs. The firm blends
          capital
          strategy with emotional intelligence, structure with soul, and the power of a global network with a
          founder-first lens. From inception to scale, 104 offers long-term strategic guidance, capital raising support,
          and alignment with values that drive enduring outcomes.
        </p>
        <p>
          What sets Joy apart is her ability to move between worlds — from sovereign corridors to village cooperatives —
          while maintaining deep empathy, integrity and strategic clarity. In a sector often driven by speed and
          short-term returns, Joy builds patiently, relationally, and with a different kind of ambition.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her work is not just to deploy capital, but to redirect its flow towards ideas that can shape society for the
          better.
        </p>
